Unbound Droplist
================

Like a Droplist field, but its content is not bound to the Sitecore tree.  It uses pipe-delimited string values as its source.

When building a template:
* Set "Unbound Droplist" as your field
* Set its "Source" value as "First Value|Second Value|Third Value"

In code, use as an original Droplist by casting as a *ValueLookupField*.

Check the README's in "src" and "release" folders for more details. 

Thanks!
